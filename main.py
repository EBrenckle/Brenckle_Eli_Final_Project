# Idea: "Path of Pain" style platformer using Unity
# Goals: Basic animations (stick figures), use of movement powerups, multiple levels.
# Movement: Double jump, Wall jump, Dash, Permeation.
# Tools: Check point function, pogo resets & heal function. (similar to Hollow Knight)
# Since I am not planning on using python and will be focusing on using Unity(C#) I am making the project more involved.
