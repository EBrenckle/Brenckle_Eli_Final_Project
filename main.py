# Idea: Metroidvania using Unity
# Goals: Basic animations (stick figures), use of movement powerups, two or more bosses, handful of different enemies. 
# Movement: Double jump, Wall jump, Dash, Permeation, etc.
# Tools: Melee weapon (with upgrades), Projectile, Heal function. (similar to Hollow Knight)
# Since I am not planning on using python and will be focusing on using Unity(C#) I am making the project more involved.
